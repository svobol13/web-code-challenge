##Deloitte Digital Code Challenge
Your challenge: create a responsive web page based on the layout comp & assets included here.

### Requirements
* "Pixel-perfect" index page as on `layout.png`.
* Responsiveness (use of `bootstrap` preferred).
* Clean output (i.e. project structure, well-formated and commented code, utilizing of git (ignore, messages, reasonable commit breakdown,...),...)
* Handling of user input on first page together with validations (what/how to validate is up to implementor).

### Bonus points
* Design and implement `contact` page so it fits the design.
* `single-command` build (i.e. production grade artifact produced (minification, obfuscation, concatenation, cleanup,...)).
* Use of `angular` or `react` especially for forms control.
